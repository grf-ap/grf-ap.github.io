I love London! 
It's such an exciting city and the shopping is great.
Although I think the shops are much more expensive than in New York.
I also love all the historic buildings.
New York is full of ugly, modern buildings, so London is much more beautiful.
The nightlife in London is really good, too.
People say London's nightlife is not as good as New York's, but I disagree.
I think London's is just as exciting.
